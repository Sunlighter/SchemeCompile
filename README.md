# SchemeCompiler

This project includes an old Scheme interpreter and an old Scheme compiler, both written in F#.

The compiler produces series of opcodes, which can be formatted to look like C#, but nothing runs that code right now.

Both support proper tail calls; the interpreter also supports call/cc.
